In this project we created a restuarant management system to allow for customers and staff memebers to interact in a virtual restaurant. Customers are able to create accounts, order food and more. Staff members are able to see orders, approve bookings, contact customers and "deliver food". All the information and functionality is nicely displayed in a GUI using fxml.

The steps below are how to compile the and run our program:

Download all the files and open up the "Group5-A2" folder in your chosen IDE. We used IntelliJ. 

Setup your IDE project structure and download the relevant libraries to run ".fxml" files on your machine. 

Start by connecting to the "MariaDB" databse using XAMPP and set up the relevant libraries so your IDE can connect to the database and server as well. 

When connected to the server set up the "structure.sql" and "data.sql" files in the "SQL" folder. This is where all the information about the customers, staff members, restaurant menu information and order history will be held.

When they have been setup you can open all the files in the "Java" folder and run the program through the "HelloApplication" file.
